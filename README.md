[CJR - What makes a good FOIA request? We studied 33,000 to find out.](http://www.cjr.org/analysis/foia-request-how-to-study.php)

+ Code by Nic & Rashida

**1/31/2017**: We're hoping to have all of our code up tonight. Important note: the current "analysis" notebook is not what the conclusions of our article are based on, but rather, simpler "gut-checks" to poke through the data, guided by some of the terms that came up in our text analysis and decision tree analysis. That code will be posted shortly!
