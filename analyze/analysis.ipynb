      "Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552 et seq.(\"FOIA\"), I request access to and copies of e-mails and documents sent between the Environmental Protection Agency and employees, executives or directors at Volkswagen AG regarding a technology that turns off emission controls in diesel-equipped VW Beetle, Golf, Jetta and Passat and Audi A3 models for sale in the U.S. in the model years 2009-2015. I am requesting correspondence covering the period from Aug. 1, 2015 to the present (“the Records”). This request is ongoing, seeking copies of (or access to) all Records as they are filed with the Environmental Protection Agency. I am further requesting that the Records be provided to me on computer files or, if not maintained on computer files, in the same format as they are currently maintained at the EPA. I am a reporter for Bloomberg News, an accredited and recognized news-gathering organization. I request the Records to inform the public about matters of public concern. As a representative of the news media, I am only required to pay for the direct cost of duplication after the first 100 pages. Please waive all applicable fees. In the event a fee waiver is not granted, I agree to pay reasonable fees for the Records, including actual costs up to $250. If you estimate that actual costs will exceed this amount, please contact me so that I may make the appropriate arrangements for payment.\n",

      "I am looking for environmental records within the past 50 years regarding the presence of underground or above ground storage tanks. The historical use of the site is unknown, so I'm not sure who would have been operating the property in the past. Also, I would like to know if there are any liens against the property, or if there have been any discharges on the property. Most paperwork, if any, will have 'Apple Dental Care' or Mr. Mahesh Patel as the recipient. The site is located at 602-606 Cross Keys Road, Sicklerville, NJ 08081. Located on Block 501, Lot 2.04.\n",

      "This is a follow up to a request to OP that has been responded to and closed.  This new request is seeking documents related to the determination of GHG reduction goals in the President’s Climate Action Plan. OAR may have this information.  Or if ORD was the lead agency within EPA on informing such efforts, it’s possible that this request should be routed to them. Note also that the request does not identify search custodians, and the term “public trust” is very broad, so more conversations with the requester may be necessary to further clarify the search. We in OP already worked with them to get closer to a proper FOIA request; they are new to the FOIA process and receptive to helpful advice.\n",

EPA ID numbers for this address include CAD981975139 (Pomona Plating '97) and CAL000092801 (Silver Works '94).  The EPA reportedly tasked the Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team (START) to begin an assessment of the Pomona Plating site in April 1998.  According to a previous records review, the last correspondence dated 30 June 2008 from the EPA Region 9 indicated dissatisfaction with a workplan submitted by Pomona Plating.   However, the workplan was not identified in the files provided by the EPA.  Does the EPA have any records post 30 June 1998 for this address, EPA ID numbers or former tenants?\n",
